      "Chris Anderson: Sam, welcome to TED. Thank you so much for coming. Sam Altman: Thank you. It's an honor. CA: Your company has been releasing\n",
      "crazy insane new models   pretty much every other week\n",
      "it feels like. I've been playing with a couple of them. I'd like to show you\n",
      "what I've been playing. So, Sora, this is the image\n",
      "and video generator. I asked Sora this: What will it look like when you share\n",
      "some shocking revelations here at TED? You want to see\n",
      "how it imagined it, you know? (Laughter) I mean, not bad, right? How would you grade that? Five fingers on all hands. SA: Very close to what I'm wearing,\n",
      "you know, it's good. CA: I've never seen you\n",
      "quite that animated. SA: No, I'm not that animated of a person. CA: So maybe a B-plus. But this one genuinely astounded me. When I asked it to come up with a diagram that shows the difference\n",
      "between intelligence and consciousness. Like  how would you do that? This is what it did. I mean, this is so simple,\n",
      "but it's incredible. What is the kind of process\n",
      "that would allow -- like this is clearly not just\n",
      "image generation. It's linking into the core intelligences\n",
      "that your overall model has. SA: Yeah, the new image\n",
      "generation model is part of GPT-4o, so it's got all\n",
      "of the intelligence in there. And I think that's one of the reasons it's been able to do these things\n",
      "that people really love. CA: I mean, if I'm a management consultant\n",
      "and I'm playing with some of this stuff, I'm thinking, uh oh,\n",
      "what does my future look like? SA: I mean, I think there are\n",
      "sort of two views you can take. You can say, oh, man,\n",
      "it's doing everything I do. What's going to happen to me? Or you can say, like through every other\n",
      "technological revolution in history, OK, now there's this new tool. I can do a lot more. What am I going to be able to do? It is true that the expectation of what we’ll have for someone\n",
      "in a particular job increases, but the capabilities\n",
      "will increase so dramatically that I think it will be easy\n",
      "to rise to that occasion. CA: So this impressed me too. I asked it to imagine Charlie Brown\n",
      "as thinking of himself as an AI. It came up with this. I thought this was actually\n",
      "rather profound. What do you think? (Laughs) I mean, the writing quality\n",
      "of some of the new models, not just here, but in detail, is really going to a new level. SA: I mean, this is\n",
      "an incredible meta answer, but there's really no way to know\n",
      "if it is thinking that or it just saw that a lot of times\n",
      "in the training set. And of course like\n",
      "if you can’t tell the difference, how much do you care? CA: So that's really interesting. We don't know. Isn't there though ... like at first glance\n",
      "this looks like IP theft. Like you guys don’t have a deal\n",
      "with the “Peanuts” estate? (Applause) You can clap about that\n",
      "all you want, enjoy. (Laughter and murmuring) I will say that I think\n",
      "the creative spirit of humanity is an incredibly important thing, and we want to build\n",
      "tools that lift that up, that make it so that new people\n",
      "can create better art, better content, write better novels that we all enjoy. I believe very deeply that humans\n",
      "will be at the center of that. I also believe that we probably\n",
      "do need to figure out some sort of new model\n",
      "around the economics of creative output. I think people have been building\n",
      "on the creativity of others for a long time. People take inspiration for a long time. But as the access to creativity\n",
      "gets incredibly democratized and people are building off\n",
      "of each other's ideas all the time, I think there are incredible\n",
      "new business models that we and others are excited to explore. Exactly what that's going to look like, I'm not sure. Clearly, there’s some cut and dry stuff, like you can’t copy someone else’s work. But how much inspiration can you take? If you say, I want to generate art\n",
      "in the style of these seven people, all of whom have consented to that, how do you, like divvy up\n",
      "how much money goes to each one? These are like big questions. But every time throughout history we have put better\n",
      "and more powerful technology in the hands of creators. I think we collectively get\n",
      "better creative output and people do just more amazing stuff. CA: An even bigger question\n",
      "is when they haven't consented to it. In our opening session,\n",
      "Carole Cadwalladr, showed, you know, \"ChatGPT give a talk in the style\n",
      "of Carole Cadwalladr\" and sure enough, it gave a talk that wasn't quite as good\n",
      "as the talk she gave, but it was pretty impressive. And she said, \"OK, it's great,\n",
      "but I did not consent to this.\" How are we going to navigate this? Like isn’t there a way, should it just be people who’ve consented? Or shouldn’t there be a model that somehow says that any\n",
      "named individual in a prompt whose work is then used,\n",
      "they should get something for that? SA: So right now, if you use\n",
      "our image-gen thing and say, I want something in the style\n",
      "of a living artist, it won't do that. But if you say I want it in the style\n",
      "of this particular like kind of vibe, or this studio or this art movement\n",
      "or whatever, it will. And obviously if you’re like, you know, output a song that is like a copy\n",
      "of a song, it won't do that. The question of like\n",
      "where that line should be and how people say like,\n",
      "this is too much, we sorted that out before\n",
      "with copyright law and kind of what fair use looks like. Again, I think in the world of AI, there will be a new model\n",
      "that we figure out. CA: From the point of view, I mean, creative people are some\n",
      "of the angriest people right now or the most scared people about AI. And the difference between\n",
      "feeling your work is being stolen from you and your future is being stolen from you, and feeling your work is being amplified\n",
      "and can be amplified, those are such different feelings. And if we could shift\n",
      "to the other one, to the second one, I think that really changes how much\n",
      "humanity as a whole embraces all this. SA: Well, again, I would say\n",
      "some creative people are very upset. Some creatives are like,\n",
      "\"This is the most amazing tool ever, I'm doing incredible new work.\" But you know like\n",
      "it’s definitely a change. And I have a lot of like\n",
      "empathy to people who are just like, \"I wish this change weren't happening. I liked the way things were before.\" CA: But in principle, you can calculate\n",
      "from any given prompt how much ... there should be some way\n",
      "of being able to calculate what percentage of a subscription,\n",
      "revenue or whatever goes towards each answer. In principle, it should be possible if one could get the rest\n",
      "of the rules figured out. It's obviously complicated. You could calculate some kind\n",
      "of revenue share, no? SA: If you're a musician and you spend\n",
      "your whole life, your whole childhood, listening to music, and then you get an idea\n",
      "and you go compose a song that is inspired by what\n",
      "you've heard before, but a new direction, it'd be very hard for you to say like, this much was from this song\n",
      "I heard when I was 11. CA: That's right. But we're talking here about the situation where someone specifically\n",
      "in a prompt names someone. SA: Well, again,\n",
      "right now, if you try to like, go generate an image in a named style, we just say that artist\n",
      "is living, we don't do it. But I think it would be cool to figure out a new model\n",
      "where if you say, I want to do it in the name\n",
      "of this artist and they opt in, there's a revenue model there. I think that's a good thing to explore. CA: So, I think the world should help you\n",
      "figure out that model quickly. And I think it will make\n",
      "a huge difference actually. I want to switch topics quickly. (Applause) The battle between\n",
      "your model and open source. How much were you shaken up\n",
      "by the arrival of DeepSeek? SA: I think open source\n",
      "has an important place. We actually, just last night,\n",
      "hosted our first community session to kind of decide the parameters\n",
      "of our open-source model and how we want to shape it. We're going to do a very\n",
      "powerful open-source model. I think this is important. We're going to do something\n",
      "near the frontier, I think, better than any current\n",
      "open-source model out there. This will not be all -- there will be people who will use this\n",
      "in ways that some people in this room, maybe you or I, don’t like. But there is going to be an important\n",
      "place for open-source models as part of the constellation here. And, you know, I think\n",
      "we were late to act on that, but we're going to do it really well now. CA: I mean, you're spending\n",
      "it seems, like an order, or even orders of magnitude more\n",
      "than DeepSeek allegedly spent, although I know there's\n",
      "controversy around that. Are you confident that the actual\n",
      "better model is going to be recognized? Or are you actually like, isn't this in some ways life-threatening\n",
      "to the notion that, yeah, by going to massive scale,\n",
      "tens of billions of dollars of investment, we can maintain an incredible lead. SA: All day long, I call people\n",
      "and beg them to give us their GPUs. We are so incredibly constrained. Our growth is going like this. DeepSeek launched,\n",
      "and it didn’t seem to impact it. There's other stuff that's happening. CA: Tell us about the growth, actually. You gave me a shocking\n",
      "number backstage there. SA: I have never seen\n",
      "growth in any company, one that I've been involved with or not, like this, like the growth of ChatGPT. It's really fun. I feel like great, deeply honored. But it is crazy to live through, and our teams are exhausted and stressed. And we’re trying to keep things up. CA: How many users do you have now? SA: I think the last time we said\n",
      "was 500 million weekly actives, and it is growing very rapidly. CA: I mean, you told me that like\n",
      "doubled in just a few weeks. Like in terms of compute\n",
      "or in terms of ... SA: I said that privately, but I guess ... CA: Oh. (Laughter) I misremembered, Sam, I'm sorry. We can edit that out of the thing\n",
      "if you really want to. And no one here would tweet it. SA: It's growing very fast. (Laughter) CA: So you're confident,\n",
      "you're seeing it grow, take off like a rocket ship, you're releasing incredible\n",
      "new models all the time. What are you seeing in your best\n",
      "internal models right now that you haven't yet shared with the world but you would love to here on this stage? SA: So first of all, you asked about, are we worried about this\n",
      "model or that model? There will be a lot\n",
      "of intelligent models in the world. Very smart models will be\n",
      "commoditized to some degree. I think we’ll have the best, and for some use you'll want that. But like, honestly,\n",
      "the models are now so smart that for most of the things\n",
      "most people want to do, they're good enough. I hope that'll change over time because people will raise\n",
      "their expectations. But like, if you're kind of\n",
      "using ChatGPT as a standard user, the model capability is very smart. But we have to build a great product, not just a great model. And so there will be a lot of people\n",
      "with great models, and we will try to build the best product. And people want their image-gen, you know, you saw some\n",
      "Sora examples for video earlier. They want to integrate it\n",
      "with all their stuff. We just launched a new feature,\n",
      "it's still called Memory, but it's way better\n",
      "than the Memory before, where this model will get to know you\n",
      "over the course of your lifetime. And we have a lot more stuff\n",
      "to come to build like this great integrated product. And, you know, I think\n",
      "people will stick with that. So there will be many models,\n",
      "but I think we will, I hope, continue to focus on building the best\n",
      "defining product in this space. CA: I mean after I saw\n",
      "your announcement yesterday that ChatGPT will know all\n",
      "of your query history, I entered, \"Tell me about me, ChatGPT, from all you know.\" And my jaw dropped, Sam, it was shocking. It knew who I was\n",
      "and all these sort of interests that hopefully mostly were\n",
      "pretty much appropriate and shareable. But it was astonishing. And I felt the sense of real excitement, a little bit queasy, but mainly excitement, actually, at how much more that would allow it\n",
      "to be useful to me. SA: One of our researchers\n",
      "tweeted, you know, kind of like yesterday or this morning, that the upload happens bit by bit. It’s not you know, that you plug\n",
      "your brain in one day. But you will talk to ChatGPT\n",
      "over the course of your life and some day, maybe if you want, it'll be listening to you\n",
      "throughout the day and sort of observing what you're doing, and it'll get to know you and it'll become this extension\n",
      "of yourself, this companion, this thing that just tries to,\n",
      "like, help you be the best, do the best you can. CA: In the movie \"Her,\" the AI basically announces\n",
      "that she's read all of his emails and decided he's a great writer and you know, persuades\n",
      "a publisher to publish him. That might be coming\n",
      "sooner than we think. SA: I don't think it will happen\n",
      "exactly like that, but yeah, I think something\n",
      "in the direction where AI -- you don’t have to just,\n",
      "like, go to ChatGPT or whatever and say, I have a question,\n",
      "give me an answer. But you're getting like,\n",
      "proactively pushed things that help you, that make you better or whatever. That does seem like it's soon. CA: So what have you seen\n",
      "that's coming up, internally, that you think is going\n",
      "to blow people's minds? Give us at least a hint\n",
      "of what the next big jaw dropper is. SA: The thing that I'm personally\n",
      "most excited about is AI for science at this point. I am a big believer that the most important\n",
      "driver of the world and people's lives getting better\n",
      "and better is new scientific discovery. We can do more things with less, we sort of push back the frontier\n",
      "of what's possible. We're starting to hear\n",
      "a lot from scientists with our latest models that they're actually just more productive\n",
      "than they were before. That's actually mattering\n",
      "to what they can discover. CA: What’s the plausible near-term\n",
      "discovery, like, room temperature -- SA: Superconductors? CA: Superconducting, yeah. Is that possible? SA: I don't think that's prevented\n",
      "by the laws of physics. So it should be possible. But we don't know for sure. I think you'll start to see some ... meaningful progress against disease\n",
      "with AI-assisted tools. You know, physics maybe\n",
      "takes a little bit longer, but I hope for it. So that's like, one direction. Another that I think is big\n",
      "is starting pretty soon, like in the coming months. Software development\n",
      "has already been pretty transformed. Like it’s quite amazing how different\n",
      "the process of creating software is now than it was two years ago. But I expect like another move\n",
      "that big in the coming months as agentic software engineering\n",
      "really starts to happen. CA: I've heard engineers say\n",
      "that they've had almost like religious-like moments\n",
      "with some of the new models where suddenly, they can do\n",
      "in an afternoon what would have taken them two years. SA: Yeah, it's like mind -- it really like, that’s been one\n",
      "of my big “feel the AGI” moments. CA: But talk about what\n",
      "is the scariest thing that you've seen. Because like, outside, a lot of people picture you as,\n",
      "you know, you have access to this stuff. And we hear all these rumors\n",
      "coming out of AI, and it's like, \"Oh my God,\n",
      "they've seen consciousness,\" or \"They've seen AGI,\" or \"They've seen some kind\n",
      "of apocalypse coming.\" Have you seen, has there been a scary moment when you've seen something\n",
      "internally and thought, \"Uh oh, we need to pay attention to this?\" SA: There have been like moments of awe. And I think with that is always like,\n",
      "how far is this going to go? What is this going to be? But there's no like,\n",
      "we don't secretly have, we're not secretly sitting\n",
      "on a conscious model or something that's capable of self-improvement\n",
      "or anything like that. You know, I ... people have very different views of what\n",
      "the big AI risks are going to be. And I myself have like\n",
      "evolved on thinking about where we're going to see those. I continue to believe there will come\n",
      "very powerful models that people can misuse in big ways. People talk a lot about the potential\n",
      "for new kinds of bioterror, models that can present\n",
      "like a real cybersecurity challenge, models that are capable\n",
      "of self-improvement in a way that leads\n",
      "to some sort of loss of control. So I think there are big risks there. And then there's a lot of other stuff, which honestly is kind of\n",
      "what I think, many people mean, where people talk about disinformation or models saying things\n",
      "that they don't like or things like that. CA: Sticking with the first of those, do you check for that\n",
      "internally before release? SA: Of course, yeah. So we have this preparedness framework that outlines how we do that. CA: I mean, you've had some\n",
      "departures from your safety team. How many people have departed,\n",
      "why have they left? SA: We have, I don't know\n",
      "the exact number, but there are clearly different views\n",
      "about AI safety systems. I would really point to our track record. There are people who will say\n",
      "all sorts of things. You know, something like 10 percent\n",
      "of the world uses our systems now a lot. And we are very proud\n",
      "of the safety track record. CA: But track record\n",
      "isn't the issue in a way -- SA: No, it kind of is. CA: Because we're talking\n",
      "about an exponentially growing power where we fear that we may wake up one day and the world is ending. So it's really not about track record, it's about plausibly saying\n",
      "that the pieces are in place to shut things down quickly\n",
      "if we see a danger. SA: Yeah, no, of course,\n",
      "of course that's important. You don't, like, wake up one day and say, \"Hey, we didn't have\n",
      "any safety process in place. Now we think the model is really smart. So now we have to care about safety.\" You have to care about it\n",
      "all along this exponential curve. Of course the stakes increase,\n",
      "and there are big challenges. But the way we learn\n",
      "how to build safe systems is this iterative process of deploying them to the world,\n",
      "getting feedback, while the stakes are relatively low,\n",
      "learning about like, this is something we have to address. And I think as we move\n",
      "into these agentic systems, there's a whole big category of new things\n",
      "we have to learn to address. CA: So let's talk about agentic systems\n",
      "and the relationship between that and AGI. I think there's confusion\n",
      "out there, I'm confused. So artificial general intelligence, it feels like ChatGPT is already\n",
      "a general intelligence. I can ask it about anything, and it comes back\n",
      "with an intelligent answer. Why isn't that AGI? SA: It doesn't ... First of all, you can't ask it anything. That's very nice of you to say, but there's a lot of things\n",
      "that it's still embarrassingly bad at. But even if we fixed those,\n",
      "which hopefully we will, it doesn't continuously learn and improve. It can't go get better at something that it's currently weak at. It can't go discover new science\n",
      "and update its understanding and do that. And it also kind of can't,\n",
      "even if we lower the bar, it can't just sort of do\n",
      "any knowledge work you could do in front of a computer. I actually, even without\n",
      "the sort of ability to get better at something\n",
      "it doesn't know yet, I might accept that\n",
      "as a definition of AGI. But the current systems, you can't say like, hey,\n",
      "go do this task for my job, and it goes off and clicks\n",
      "around the internet and calls someone and looks\n",
      "at your files and does it. And without that,\n",
      "it feels definitely short of it. CA: I mean, do you guys have internally\n",
      "a clear definition of what AGI is, and when do you think\n",
      "that we may be there? SA: It's like the joke, if you’ve got 10 OpenAI\n",
      "researchers in a room and ask to define AGI,\n",
      "you’d get 14 definitions. CA: That's worrying, though, isn't it? Because that has been\n",
      "the mission initially, “We’re going to be\n",
      "the first to get to AGI. We'll do so safely. But we don't have a clear\n",
      "definition of what it is.\" SA: I was going to finish the answer. CA: Sorry. SA: What I think matters though, and what people want to know\n",
      "is not where is this one, you know, magic moment of, “We finished.” But given that what looks\n",
      "like is going to happen is that the models are just going to get\n",
      "smarter and more capable and smarter and more capable, on this long exponential, different people will call it AGI\n",
      "at different points. But we all agree it’s going to go\n",
      "way, way past that. You know, to whatever you want\n",
      "to call these systems that get much more capable than we are. The thing that matters\n",
      "is how do we talk about a system that is safe through all\n",
      "of these steps and beyond, as the system gets\n",

      "these systems were going to have and how to make them safe, that we acted with precaution. I think a lot of your questions earlier\n",

      "a very powerful talk here this week in which he said that the key\n",
      "problem, in his view, was that you and your peers\n",
      "in these other models all feel basically, that the development\n",

      "believes it is inevitable, that is a pathway\n",
      "to serious risk and instability. Do you think that you and your peers\n",
      "do feel that it's inevitable, and can you see any pathway out of that where we could collectively agree to just slow things down a bit, have society as a whole\n",
      "weigh in a bit and say, no, you know, we don't want this\n",

      "kind of caring about this. Now we did make a change recently\n",
      "to how we think about one part of what's traditionally\n",
      "been understood as safety. Which is, with our new image model, we've given users much more freedom on what we would traditionally\n",
      "think about as speech harms. You know, if you try\n",
      "to get offended by the model, will the model let you be offended? And in the past, we've had much\n",
      "tighter guardrails on this. But I think part of model alignment is following what the user\n",
      "of a model wants it to do within the very broad bounds\n",
      "of what society decides. So if you ask the model to depict a bunch\n",
      "of violence or something like that or to sort of reinforce some stereotype, there's a question of whether\n",
      "or not it should do that. And we're taking a much more\n",
      "permissive stance. There's a place where that starts\n",
      "to interact with real-world harms that we have to figure out how\n",
      "to draw the line for, but, you know, I think there will be cases\n",
      "where a company says, OK, we've heard the feedback from society. People really don't want\n",
      "models to censor them in ways that they don't think make sense. That's a fair safety negotiation. CA: But to the extent\n",
      "that this is a collective, a problem of collective belief, the solution to those kinds\n",

CA: Your company has been releasing\\ncrazy insane new models   pretty much every other week\\nit feels like. I\\'ve been playing with a couple of them. I\\'d like to show you\\nwhat I\\'ve been playing. So, Sora, this is the image\\nand video generator. I asked Sora this: What will it look like when you share\\nsome shocking revelations here at TED? You want to see\\nhow it imagined it, you know? (Laughter) I mean, not bad, right? How would you grade that? Five fingers on all hands. SA: Very close to what I\\'m wearing,\\nyou know, it\\'s good. CA: I\\'ve never seen you\\n\\nare getting more capable, we have a system where we all\\nget to understand what\\'s being released in the world. I think this is really important. And I think we’re not far away\\nfrom models that are going to be of great public interest in that sense. CA: So Sam, I asked\\nyour o1-pro reasoning model, which is incredibly -- SA: Thank you for the 200 dollars. CA: (Laughs) 200 dollars a month. It\\'s a bargain at the price. I said, what is the single most\\npenetrating question I could ask you? It thought about it for two minutes. Two minutes. You want to see the question? SA: I do. CA: \"Sam, given that you\\'re\\nhelping create technology that could reshape the destiny\\nof our entire species, who granted you (or anyone)\\nthe moral authority to do that?” (Laughter) \"And how are you personally\\n\\nthat was much more powerful than anything being done. I mean, it is amazing what you\\'ve built. But the other narrative\\nis that you have shifted ground, that you\\'ve shifted from being OpenAI, this open thing, to the allure of building\\nsomething super powerful. And you know, you’ve lost\\nsome of your key people. There\\'s a narrative out there. Some people believe that you\\'re not\\nto be trusted in this space. I would love to know who you are. What is your narrative about yourself? What are your core values, Sam, that can give us, the world, confidence that someone with so much\\npower here is entitled to it? SA: Look, I think like anyone else,\\nI\\'m a nuanced character that doesn\\'t reduce well\\nto one dimension here. You know, probably some\\nof the good things are true and probably some\\n\\nover the course of your lifetime. And we have a lot more stuff\\nto come to build like this great integrated product. And, you know, I think\\npeople will stick with that. So there will be many models,\\nbut I think we will, I hope, continue to focus on building the best\\ndefining product in this space. CA: I mean after I saw\\nyour announcement yesterday that ChatGPT will know all\\nof your query history, I entered, \"Tell me about me, ChatGPT, from all you know.\" And my jaw dropped, Sam, it was shocking. It knew who I was\\nand all these sort of interests that hopefully mostly were\\npretty much appropriate and shareable. But it was astonishing. And I felt the sense of real excitement, a little bit queasy, but mainly excitement, actually, at how much more that would allow it',\n",
